## Entity Component System

The Entity Component System offers a better approach to game design that allows you to concentrate on the actual problems you are solving: the data and behavior that make up your game. It leverages the C# Job System and Burst Compiler enabling you to take full advantage of today's multicore processors. Moving from object-oriented to data-oriented design makes it easier for you to reuse the code and easier for others to understand and work on it.

The Entity Component System ships as an experimental package that currently supports Unity 2018.3 and later. It is important to stress that the Entity Component System is not production ready.

## C# Job System

The new C# Job System takes advantage of multiple cores in a safe and easy way.

## Burst

Burst is a new LLVM-based, math-aware backend compiler. It compiles C# jobs into highly-optimized machine code.
