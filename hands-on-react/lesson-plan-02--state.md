# State and Basic Lifecycle

## Prerequisites

* This will build off the project in lesson 01

## Lesson - Creating and Using State

* constructor
* super()
* setting state in the constructor
* use state in render

## Activity - Mimic

* Have them set the count in state for autocounter and render that

## Lesson - Lifecycle Methods

* Show `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`
* Set timer and increment value
* setState()
* Discuss virtual dom

## Activity - Mimic

* Have them implement their own timers

## Activity

* Pass the timeout value as props
* Use multiple Autocounters

## Instruction - Functional Components

**Goal**: Introduce functional components so they'll know what they are but, more importantly at this point, recognize them when they look at documentation and blog posts.

* Hand Off
* Show functional component - extract header
* Pass props - pass header text
* Auto ; insertion error - display and show how to avoid

## Activity - Mimic

* Extract header into another file as a functional component

## Other Resources

Covers the following topics in the React docs.

* [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

Want to revisit anything? Topics here are also touched on in these screencasts.

## Homework

* Create a clock component - Create a component that shows the current time and updates every second. They build this in the [State and Lifecycle docs page for React](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Bonus points - can you keep track of and display how many times the component re-renders?
