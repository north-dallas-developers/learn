# Introduction

In this part of the lab we will get familiar with create-react-app and making basic React components.

## Section 1: The Tour

In this section we take a look around an app created with create-react-app.

**Activity**

* Change some text in the app and make sure you see the change in your browser.
* Make some invalid markup (maybe don't close a tag) and see the error. Then fix it.

## Section 2: Our First Component

Here we'll create our first component.

**Activity**

* Create your own autocounter component

This is what we're going to build today.

## Section 3: Introducing Props

Props allow you to pass values into components, an essential bit of knowledge.

**Activity**

* Pass a header value into your autocounter component and render that in the component.
