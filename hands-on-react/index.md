## Hands-On React

These are the resources for the Hands-On React training for the North Dallas Developers Group. These are the lessons in order.

All of this training assumes that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) installed.

You will see videos and activities throughout these lessons. The videos are for you to review, to use if the live lab is too slow, or to use if it is going too quickly. All the same material should be presented both live and in the videos, so you don't have to worry about missing something. The activities are for you to practice what we are discussing. This is a hands-on lab, meaning that you need to do some coding!
