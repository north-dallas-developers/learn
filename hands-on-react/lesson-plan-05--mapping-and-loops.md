# Mapping and Loops

**Goal**: Learn React's way of handling repeated elements

## Lesson - Learn the Basics of Mapping

* Create a new component.
* Put an array of strings in state.
* Introduce `map`. Do *not* assume everyone has seen this.
* Render the list but don't specify a `key`.
* Show how it worked.
* Show the key missing error.
* Add a key (show the `index` value passed as second argument of `map`)

## Activity - Mimic

* Have them do the same, but with their own array

## Lesson - Mapping Objects

* Create an array of objects in state
* Map and render the objects (use an id from the objects as key)
* Show the error you get when you put an object directly into the JSX
