# Controlled Inputs

**Goal**: Make controlled inputs in React less weird

## Lesson - A Basic Controlled Input

* Create a new component.
* Add an input
* Bind the value to state and show that it can't be changed
* Update state in `onChange` and discuss `evt.target.value`
* Show the state update in the React browser plugin
* Mirror the state in another styled dom element

## Activity - Mimic

* Have them make their own component, except with their own styles
