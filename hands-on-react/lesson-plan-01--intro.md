# Intro

**Goal**: Get them familiar with `create-react-app`, how to start it, where it puts files, changing files, and show them their first error message.

* **Create a new app** called `easy-react`.
* **Review structure**, showing component files, css files, and public folder
* **run `yarn test`** so they can see the integrated tests
* **Show hot reloading**

* Make some invalid markup and see the errors you get

## Instruction - Creating Our First Component

**Goal**: Show them how to create their first component and help them avoid the common multiple-root-node error.

* **Hand Off** - It is helpful to tell them to pay attention because they will get a chance to do it themselves in a bit.
* **Show the multiple root node error** in App.js
* **Create a counter component**, showing importing `React`, `class` and `extends`, and `export default`
* **Import into App.js** so they can see it

## Activity - Mimic

## Instruction - Props

**Goal**: Introduce props

* **Hand Off**
* **Show passing props** - pass autocounter header
* **Use props**
