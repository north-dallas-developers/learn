In this part of the lab we will get familiar with create-react-app and making basic React components.

* Render that count

## Section 2: Lifecycle

There is a lifecycle to React components. Here we learn how to use it for our autocounter.

**Activity**

* Add the timer to your autocounter component an increment the counter.
* Extra: pass the interval time as props into the component so different autocounters can go at different speeds.
