# Inline and Block and Inline Block

Let's start with a few basics.

> Inline elements are as wide as their content, and their dimensions cannot be set with CSS.

&lt;span style=\"border: solid 1px red; width: 500px;\"&gt;This is an inline element.&lt;/span&gt;

> Block elements span the width of their container by default but can have their dimensions set with CSS.


&lt;div style=\"border: solid 1px red; width: 500px;\"&gt;This is an block element.&lt;/div&gt;

> Inline-block elements by default are as wide as their content, but their dimensions can be set with CSS.

&lt;div style=\"border: solid 1px red; display: inline-block;\"&gt;This is an block element, but changed to inline-block.&lt;/div&gt;
