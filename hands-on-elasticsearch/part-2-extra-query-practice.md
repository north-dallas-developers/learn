title: Hands-On Elasticsearch - Part 2 - Extra Query Practice

Here are some practice queries to run against the ecommerce data. I have included some types of queries that we haven't discussed. That would be terribly mean, except that I included a video below showing how to do all these. I'm doing all these queries in only the Discover interface of Kibana.

*Task*: Find all transactions made in the city of New York.

*Task*: Find all transactions made in the city of New York on a Monday.

*Task*: Find all transactions made in the city of New York or Los Angeles.

*Task*: Find all transactions made in the city of New York on a weekend.

*Task*: Find all transactions made in the city of Los Angeles that had a `taxful_total_price` of greater than $70.00.

*Task*: Find all transactions that had a total quantity of 4.

*Task*: Find all transactions that had a total quantity of 2 and at least one item was in the category of "Men's Shoes".

*Task*: Find all transactions that were either made by men or that included "Men's Clothing".
